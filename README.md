This is a game about using videogames to escape from a prison. I wanted to be very explicit when the player is in a video game or not, as you will see in the game. In the game you move through televisions into virtual worlds where you do some platforming


The televisions were the last thing to add into the game (contrary to the title) so they are really rough around the edges. I would spend more time on them but I don't really have time to spend on them


Initially intended on adding a timer for speed runs but that didn't happen.


Also during the final build a lot of my optimizations got corrupted (had to git restore) so this version has framerate issues


Other planned features include indicators of in which direction the moving platforms were going. And the virtual worlds were not supposed to have televisions inside of them. The televisions would be in the real world and a portal would be in the virtual world.
